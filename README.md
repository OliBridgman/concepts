#Concepts

A list of ideas that will most likely never be made.

##Museum Curator Tycoon

Tycoon game. In a museum. That you curate.
Weird and wonderful pieces throughout history and pop culture are collectable.
The Necronomicon. Shakespeare's Skull. Dead Sea Scrolls. Voynich Manuscript. etc.

##Walking Simulator

Walk to the store. Control the character's movement via a rhythm engine.
Unfortunately, the rhythm being played is a glitch track with irrational changes.
If the input is incorrect the character stumbles, causing npcs around the character
to stare awkwardly. the more the character stumbles, the more awkward stares the
character gets. Complete the game by successfully navigating to the store without
causing a scene.

##Conference Simulator

You are at a conference. It's the morning tea break. You're currently unemployed
and need to find a job. You're going to 'network'. Point-and-click style adventure
with one room full of people. Converse with these people, collecting as many business
cards/job interviews as you can. The problem is that the sentence options available to
you are large, and often times comically bad. You do not have time to read them all
as the people you're conversing with will think you're an idiot if you stand there
not saying anything for too long. Quickly skim/guess the correct response to the various
questions you'll face without making a fool of yourself.

##Ninja Simon Says

Infinite runner, a ninja running right. Control the game by inputting drum sequences.
These sequences are played to the user prior to inputting the sequence, basically, simon says.
The drumming is Taiko, hence the ninja, mainly so we're not constrained to some 4/4 timing.
Also once the user inputs the sequence, the ninja 'plays' the sequence. The landscape of the
runner matches the pattern that was heard, so the ninja jumps gaps when bass drums hit,
scales walls when smaller drums hit, etc. During this visual representation of the sequence,
the user must also complete melodic sequences to complement the drum sequence, slicing
and slashing enemies.

##More Drums

Similar to ninja simon says, but as a real time puzzle game. Each level is a drum pattern.
The character is a ball. The user builds a character movement pattern with a drum sequencer,
solving the level by playing the right drum beat to navigate the character through the moving
platforms. Bass jumps low, snare jumps high, other things do other things.

##Horrorlogy

You're Death, the Grim Reaper. You're in a hotel. You have to kill _everyone_. The game is
time based. You can only affect the environment in small but meaningful ways, causing
either small accidents or major catastrophes. Causing the death of one person at 8am may
mean that it is impossible to cause the death of another later in the game. You can travel
back in time to the beginning of the day to replay. Groundhog Day meets Final Destination.

##It's Not You, It's Me

Groundhog day, but for the day your romantic relationship falls apart. Revisit the same
horrible conversations, trying to find some way to make it all work. It never works.
And if you somehow do beat the game, the date changes, the partner changes, and you're still
having the same conversations.
