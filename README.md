#Concepts

A list of ideas that will most likely never be made.

##Museum Curator Tycoon

Tycoon game. In a museum. That you curate.
Weird and wonderful pieces throughout history and pop culture are collectable.
The Necronomicon. Shakespeare's Skull. Dead Sea Scrolls. Voynich Manuscript. etc.

##Walking Simulator

Walk to the store. Control the character's movement via a rhythm engine.
Unfortunately, the rhythm being played is a glitch track with irrational changes.
If the input is incorrect the character stumbles, causing npcs around the character
to stare awkwardly. the more the character stumbles, the more awkward stares the
character gets. Complete the game by successfully navigating to the store without
causing a scene.

##Conference Simulator

You are at a conference. It's the morning tea break. You're currently unemployed
and need to find a job. You're going to 'network'. Point-and-click style adventure
with one room full of people. Converse with these people, collecting as many business
cards/job interviews as you can. The problem is that the sentence options available to
you are large, and often times comically bad. You do not have time to read them all
as the people you're conversing with will think you're an idiot if you stand there
not saying anything for too long. Quickly skim/guess the correct response to the various
questions you'll face without making a fool of yourself.
